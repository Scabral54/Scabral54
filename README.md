Hello, 
I'm @Scabral54 I am interested in technology and figuiring out how it works. I have always had an interest in computers and technology. I have been building computers for the past 13 years. My favorite one was my Xbox 360 case with a sff pc inside.
I am currently working on my Data analytics skills with SQL, Excel, Python, and Tableu. My Portfolio Projects repository is an example of some of the projects I have created. I am looking to progress futher into the Data Analytics field and look forward
to creating more projects as I continue to learn and learn more advanced techniques.
